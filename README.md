*The module improves edit-distance checks for strings by sorting the strings and then running the edit-distance algorithm.*

*eg.*

```
Previous String A = dark apple eat
Previous String B = eat dark apple

# Now these strings will be sorted first : 

New String A = apple dark eat
New String B = apple dark eat  

```
